  This project simulates a Pokemon game. The interface shows the user 
  what different attacks that the Pokemon could use to defeat their enemies,
  including the Pokemon's attacks, element, and stats. Users will use their 
  own keyboard to type different letters to progress along a story plot. If the 
  user decides attack another Pokemon, the statistics of both Pokemon will be 
  shown in the terminal. After each battle, the user's Pokemon will receive a different 
  amount of EXP to increase their statistics and their attacks.
